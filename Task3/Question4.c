/*QUESTION#4
A car travelled back and forth from point A to point B. With a distance being (single trip) 1207KM. During
the forward trip fuel price was 118/liter while returning it was 123/liter. Calculate the total fuel cost
(both ways) and the fuel consumed (total trip). Use the carâ€™s fuel average as input from the user (Input
must be positive make some restrictions on only accepting positive input)*/

#include <stdio.h>

    float fuelAverage, fuelConsumedForward, fuelConsumedReturn;
    float totalFuelConsumed, totalFuelCostForward, totalFuelCostReturn, totalFuelCost;

    printf("Enter the car's fuel average (positive number): ");

    if (fuelAverage <= 0) {
        printf("Error: Fuel average must be a positive number.\n");
        return 1;  // Exit the program with an error code
    }

    fuelConsumedForward = DISTANCE_ONE_WAY / fuelAverage;
    fuelConsumedReturn = DISTANCE_ONE_WAY / fuelAverage;

    totalFuelCostForward = fuelConsumedForward * FUEL_PRICE_FORWARD;
    totalFuelCostReturn = fuelConsumedReturn * FUEL_PRICE_RETURN;
    totalFuelCost = totalFuelCostForward + totalFuelCostReturn;

Q4: Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6).
If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.

Ask user to input n
Ask user to input N
if(n%N==0), then display "Yes it is a divisor" and go to step 5
else display"No, It is not a divisor"
if(N%2==0), then display"N is an even number"
else display "N is an odd number"
